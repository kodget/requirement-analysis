  <h1>Why is Requirement Analysis Important?</h1>
  <div>
   <h3>requirement analysis is important because of the following reasons:</h3>
  </div>
   <ul>
  <li>Clarity and alignment: It provides clarity about the detials of the project such as project scope, cost, time frame, and other important variables to make key decisions in the project
  </li>
  <li>
    Quality assurance: Requirement analysis helps to ascertain that a project meets its required quaility. This could be done by deifining and working towards certain acceptance criteria.
  </li>
  <li>Project scope: It helps to clearly define the scope of a project and prevent scope creep which can unnecessarily delay or prevent launch.</li>
</ul>

  <h1>Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.</h1>
  <ul>
   <li><em>Requirement Gathering</em>: this is a system of gathering information from the stakeholders with interviews, surveys, and  questionaires to have a detailed scope of the project</li>
   <li><em>Requirement Elicitation</em>: this is a step further after requirement gathering. Brainstorming, focus groups experiments, and prototyping should happen here</li>
   <li><em>Requirement Documentation</em>: it entails drawing up a requirements secification document, user stories, and use cases for the project
   <li><em>Requirement Analysis and Modeling</em>: the document is then analysed and modelled into visual form. It also entails requirements prioritization: placing the requirements in order of importance</li>
   <li><em>Requirement Validation</em>: the requirement analysis is then validated by meeting the acceptance criteria</li>
  </ul>
